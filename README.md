#Why and How It's Made
This is a web based, action adventure game. When I was younger I always loved playing different video games online, specifically on armorgames.com and addictinggames.com. The heart of almost every online game was Adobe Flash Player. Unfortunately, on Decemeber 31st, 2020, Adobe Flash Player was discontinued and all of the games I once loved to play were now unavailable. Video games are what led myself to pursue a carrer in tech and ultimately a degree in computer science. I have always wanted to create some kind of video game but for a long time did not have the skills to do so until now. This game uses Unity along with many different sprites and audio sources found online. Due to the use of the Unity game engine, this game utilizes C#. This game can be found on my portfolio website located at masonbrill.me. Please take a look and enjoy!
